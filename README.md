### How it works üëáüèª

### Tech stack üß∞

- ReactJs | Next.js | Node.js | MongoDB | JavaScript | TypeScript | TailwindCSS
- Postman for API routes testing | Cloudinary CDN | Figma for UI/UX design | Visual Studio Code | npm | Linux |  Git and Github

### Details 

- Enhanced the user and developer experience by integrating the **React Context API** and **Custom Hooks**.
- Implemented **debouncing** on certain functions, in order to reduce the API calls and improve overall UX.
- Implemented a stable solution for dealing with image manipulation by relying on Cloudinary SaaS CDN, **improving performance by 90%** on fetching posts.
- Secured sensitive information by adhering to using .env variables in all branches of the project.
- All project routes are protected by verifying **JWT Token**. You can only access the app by validating the token with the API.
- For UI I followed a **mobile-first approach** recommended by TailwindCSS best practices, now with Light and Dark mode!
- Focused on creating an **accessible-friendly** experience, with a **95+ overall score** on Lighthouse scans.
